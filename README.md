# Automated Template System

## Description

The Automated Template System enables the managing and maintaining of documentation standards within a company, 
providing enough flexibility and ease of use to enhance the overall productivity and efficiency of Microsoft Word users 
in a company. It speeds up the process of producing documents that have a consistent and professional appearance.

## Development

Please fork the repository and maintain it in your own fork. This project is closed for development, and no pull 
requests, issues, or questions will be considered.

Git clone the repository to `C:\Templates` and use that as the base folder. The VBA password is in 
`\Generic\BaseTemplate\Passwords.txt`. The master template is in `\Generic\BaseTemplate\BaseTemplate.dotm`, while the 
sub-templates are in `\MyCompany\MyCompany_Form`, `\MyCompany\MyCompany_Letter`, and `\MyCompany\MyCompany_Main` 
respectively.

To create a new set of templates other than `MyCompany`, please follow the instructions in 
`\MyCompany\ProcessForNewTemplatesSet.txt`. To deploy the new template set, please (rename then) run 
`\MyCompany\Deploy_MyCompany_Templates.bat`. (The original source code control system used for this software product was 
Subversion; just ignore references to it.)

## Use

Please read the user manual in `\Generic\UserManual` - this will be deployed together with a new template set.
